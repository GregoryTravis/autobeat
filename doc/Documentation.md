When using Rhythmr, you are presented with a set of loops, playing in unison. If you like what you hear, hit the right arrow, and you'll get another one to listen to. If you don't like it, hit the left arrow.

As you do this, good-sounding combinations of the loops appear in the upper right. Once you have a few, you can generate a song from them by hitting "S" or "J". If you like the song, write it to disk using "W".

When you start up, a pool of loops is selected, shown in the upper left. This is often only a subset of the loops contained in the project. When you get bored with these, hit "E" ("new pool") to load a new set. (The ones you've already liked will stay.)

"Cycle affinities" (the "c" key) generates another song using the same groups of loops, but in different combinations. Sometimes it sounds very similar, sometimes very different.
