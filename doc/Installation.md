## Installing Rhythmr on OS X

**Note: since this is not from the app store, you won't be able to simply download and run it; see below.**

1. Delete any previously-installed copy of Rhythmr
1. Go <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1W6Vl_5WIIZrt0X9-fma3C0XrTg8mViJ3?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>
1. Right-click on "Rhythmr.zip"
1. Select "Download"
1. Once it's downloaded, double-click the downloaded zip file, which should create a folder called "Rhythmr" on your desktop
1. (You can delete Rhythmr.zip.)
1. Open the Rhythmr folder
1. **Important**: To run Rhythmr the first time:
   1. Right-click on the Rhythmr app
   1. Select Open
   1. Say yes when it asks you if you really want to open it
   1. (Next time you can open Rhythmr normally)
1. Double click one of the projects
1. (Running the app directly doesn't work right on all versions of OSX, but it might work for you.)
